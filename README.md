# Character-Lexicon
A character compendium for RPGs - specifically Persona 3; written in C++ with Vim; converted from a data structures class project for implementing a binary search tree.

Goals: resolve current runtime errors/inefficiencies, convert binary search tree structure into a balanced tree, store all characters once entered or until deleted from the compendium.
